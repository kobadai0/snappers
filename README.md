This is sample web site based on 「HTML & CSS とWebデザインが1冊できちんと身につく本」.  
I created the following four representative layouts using HTML and CSS.

* __Full Screen__
  * A large photo is used in the background of the top page to give the site more impact.
* __Single Column__
  * Simple and Basic Layout. It is easy to see even on smartphones with small screens. 
* __Two Column__
  * Single Column and Side Bar. This is useful when you want to increase traffic on your website, such as on a large e-commerce site, or when you want to post supplementary information such as banner ads.
* __Grid__
  * A layout that arranges elements along a grid of evenly spaced lines. It is used by media sites that display photos and articles.
